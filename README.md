# Public-Key-Infrastructure-And-SSH-Security-Lab
You will learn how Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and digital certificates secure web traffic using SSL/TLS, and how SSH key-based authentication replaces passwords to provide safer remote access. You’ll also practice generating, installing, and verifying cryptographic keys using tools like OpenSSL and ssh-keygen.
