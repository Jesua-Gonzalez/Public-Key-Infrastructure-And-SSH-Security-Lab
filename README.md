# LABTAINER EXERCISE 
# EXPLORE PUBLIC KEY CERTIFICATES FROM A VARIETY OF WEB SITES 
# USE PUBLIC/PRIVATE KEY PAIR TO ACCESS A SERVER VIA SSH

This is an open public lab devloped by the [Naval Post Graduate School](https://nps.edu/).\
The tasks/instructions of this project can be found in pubkey.pdf (lab #1) & sshlab.pdf (lab #2)

The report of this project can be found in Public Key Infrastructure And SSH Security.pdf, 
which shows all the steps, commands, results and explanations you will use or meet in this lab.

You will learn how Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and digital certificates secure web traffic using SSL/TLS, and how SSH key-based authentication replaces passwords to provide safer remote access. You’ll also practice generating, installing, and verifying cryptographic keys using tools like OpenSSL and ssh-keygen.

Hope my understanding and documentation helps others get a better grasp of the topic at hand!!!\
You can reach out anytime for questions or even discussions!


To setup the working environment refer to the refrence link at the bottom but here is a quick checklist:\
**!!FYI this lab was conducted using a 2022 M2 chip MacBook air device!!**
1. Download the UTM application from store it is free
2. Download the image container file (.qcow2 extension) from [Naval Post Graduate School Images](https://nps.edu/)
3. Open the UTM and then 'create an emulated virtual machine';
4. Use the image and complete setup
